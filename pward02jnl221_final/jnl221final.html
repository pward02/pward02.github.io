        <p>In the storm of attack ads that came with New York’s 2022 gubernatorial race, one of Republican candidate Lee Zeldin’s pieces may have caught your eyes or ears by pinning a “surge in crime” in the Empire State on the policies of his opponent, incumbent Kathy Hochul. “Vote like your life depends on it, because it does,” Zeldin says in the brief video.</p>
		  
        <p>However, recent <a href="https://data.ny.gov/Public-Safety/Adult-Arrests-18-and-Older-by-County-Beginning-197/rikd-mt35/data" target="_blank">adult arrest data</a> collected by New York State suggests that the level of crime in New York shows almost no evidence of a major increase (like the one Zeldin describes) from the recorded levels that have been collected in the state’s recent history, outside of the year 2020 (dating back to 1970).</p>
		  
        <p>According to the first-hand experiences of Tim Hardy, Deputy Director of Public Safety at Washington County (NY), there has been a noticeable jump in the amount of calls that his department has received over the past 12 to 24 months. Hardy’s department works closely with first responding units in Washington County, which was one of the 48 New York counties that favored Zeldin to Hochul in the recent election. “When speaking about incidents in general, we have seen significant increases in overdoses, mental health calls, and things like that,” Hardy said. “Those kinds of things tend to escalate into calls for service in other areas, such as ones that are criminal in nature.”</p>
		  
        <p>The only year since 2010 in the data collection that 2021 is a sharp increase from is 2020, which is isolated in how low its yearly statewide total was. “The pandemic has certainly had significant effects on multiple levels - again most notably from the communications side of things in terms of calls for overdoses and significant increases in mental health incidents,” according to Hardy. “It seems like we were on our toes much more often last year and this year than we were when the pandemic was going on.”</p>

</script>

		  
        <p>That sentiment goes for most of the general population as well. As vaccinations were administered, masking guidelines were lifted, and time was passing, people all began their own version of a “return to normalcy” after the gauntlet that was the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hardy believes that once the bad eggs have started returning, so have the criminal consequences of their actions.</p>
		  
		  <p>This theory isn't mentioned in Zeldin's advertisement, however.</p>
		  
		 
		  
        <p>In the November 2022 gubernatorial election, Zeldin received more votes than his Democrat opponent Hochul in 48 of New York’s 62 total counties. Out of those 48 counties Zeldin won, only 6 saw an increase in the total number of combined misdemeanors and felonies since 2019, the last recorded year without any kind of influence from the COVID-19 pandemic. Those that did see increases saw them in very minor amounts.</p>
		  
		  <iframe title="Change In Crime Totals in Counties Won By Lee Zeldin" aria-label="Pie Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-prUQD" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/prUQD/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="607" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>

       <p>What also begs questioning is the amount of blame for the increase in crime that can be put on Kathy Hochul’s bail reform policies. Hochul, after all, had only served just over 13 months as New York’s first female governor after taking over upon Andrew Cuomo’s resignation in August of 2021. At the time of writing, no similar full year data for the year 2022 is available to the public, and any attempts at trying to find estimates came up without any success.</p>
		  
	<p>However, <a href="https://scri.siena.edu/2022/12/13/by-wide-margins-voters-say-hochul-did-not-make-progress-on-several-2022-goals-making-communities-safer-enhancing-trust-in-state-govt-transforming-suny-to-envy-of-nation-making-ny-place-to-live/" target="_blank">a recent study by Siena College</a> discovered that New York voters see the rise in crime as a “very serious problem”, and something that should be one of Governor Hochul’s top priorities as she enters her first full term as New York’s governor. Siena Pollster Steven Greenberg laid out the results of the poll by saying “voters say crime is a top priority because 90% say crime is a serious problem – 59% very serious – across New York State, compared to 92% in June. And because 63% say it’s a serious problem in their community – 28% very serious – compared to 65% in June. And because 61% say they’re concerned that they could be the victim of a crime –26% very concerned – compared to 60% in June,” Greenberg said.</p>
		  
		  
	<p>When it comes to the debate as to whether or not there is a big wave of crime surging throughout the state of New York, it appears as if everybody is at least partially correct. There is an increase in crime rates, as Lee Zeldin mentioned. However, the increase in those rates is not something that we should feel completely blindsided by. As we all returned to normal after 2020, it appears as if New York’s statewide crime rates are doing the same.
